OOPS CONCEPT :-

1. ABSTRACTION 2. ENCAPSULATION 3. Inheritance 4. polymorphism 


1. ENCAPSULATION TOPIC KA PART HAI Y SB 


suppose if we have a precious item like a diamomd to protect them we put them inside  a locker and lock it with a key . similalrly 
in java , to protect the data , we put the data inside a class and craete an object to the class . so how we can a diamond from a locker by using key similalry 
by using object we can access the data from the class .

encapsulation is a concept in which we combine a data and code into one single unit (class).
the main advantage of encapsultaion is data security.

HERE DATA IS VARIABLES VALUE , CODE IS METHOD AND LOCKER IS CLASS  AND KEY IS OBJECT 


CLASS :- class is a collection of data and code 

Method :- method is a set of instructions defined insiade a class and performds  some operations on data 

Objectc;- it is an instance of class. once object is created a memory is allocated to the data 
for every objetc seprate memory allocation will be done 


type of methods 

1. a method void no return value 
2. a method return value 

a method which returns value we need to store in a variable and then call 


package secondproject;

 

class One

{

	int aa=60; int bb=70;

	public void show()

	{

		aa++;

		System.out.println(aa);

	}

	public  int display()

	{

		 bb--;

		 return bb;

		

	}

 

	

	}

 

 

public class Hello 

{

 

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		

		One obj=new One();

		   obj.show();

	int	 cc = obj.display();        ////  a method which returns value we need to store in a variable and then call 


System.out.println(cc);

					  		

		 }     

	 

	

 

}



type of variables 
1.local 
2.instance 




encapsultion is for data security


CALL BY VALUE 



package secondproject;

 

class One

{

	int aa;double cc;char dd;boolean ee;

	public void show( int  bb1,double cc1,char dd1, boolean  ee1)

	{

		aa=bb1;

		cc=cc1;

		dd=dd1;

		ee=ee1;

		System.out.println(aa+""+cc+""+dd+""+ee);

	}

	}

 

 

public class Hello 

{

 

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

			One obj=new One();

			  obj.show(60,67.7,'m',true);

		

	

		 }     

	 

	

 

}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS KEYWORD


syntax : this.variablename;

this keyword refers to current object (class variables values). Suppose in a class if the locla varibale name and the class varinles name are same ,
then to differntiate between local variable and a class varibales we use this keyword.

if we use this keyword , then jvm will point to class variable of an object.
syntax : this.variablename;


eg :- 

package secondproject;

 

class One

{

	int aa;

	public void show( int  aa)

	{

		this.aa=aa;

	

		System.out.println(aa);

	}

	}

 

 

public class Hello 

{

 

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

			One obj=new One();

			  obj.show(60);

		

	

		 }     

	 

	

 

}

this keyword for multiple variable k liye code lik  homework

2. *********************ABSTRACTION************************* 


hiding the body of method is abstraction  ans showing essentials features like a method declartion or signatue

method body is provide for code security 


Real time example :- suppose if we want to drive a car , as a car driver i need to know the basic functinality of a car like staring the engine , applying accelaetrtior ,
breaks ,stiring etc it is enough for me to drive a car but the background thing of a car like petrol consumption etc are not required for a car driver
and they are hidden , similarly in java for methods you will show the method signature and we will hide method body .


public void methodname () - method signatue/ method declartion
{
-------------------method body /method definition
}


abstractionis is a concept in which we represnt (show) the essential feature (method signatue) hiding the background details (method body)
the main advanyage of abstractionis code security.


In order to implement abstarction oops concept , their are two ways by using 
1.abstarct keyword( non access modifier)
2. using interfaces 


homework

1.write a java programe for call by value for 

    datatypes int,float,char,string,boolean 

 2.write a java programe for this keyword for two variables

 3.write a java programe to calculate GST value for the purchases 

   amount using encapsulation

     

        o/p:

    purchases :  10000

   cst@9%     :    900

   sst@9%     :    900

  GST@18%     :  1800

 

    total bill  :11800
